### Ideas
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/fight-songs/fight-songs.csv
- Are these fight songs played before or after the game and does it depend on if the team won?
- Do teams with fight songs have better records than teams who don't have fight songs?
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/foul-balls/foul-balls.csv
- Does the weather factor in to the amount of foul balls hit per game?
- Does the time of the game affect the amount of foul balls; does it matter if it's the post-season or regular season?
